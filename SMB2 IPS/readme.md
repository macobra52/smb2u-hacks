Super Mario Bros 2 
==================

All the following patches work for smb2 (original or Rev A, unless labeled accordingly) and any romhacks that do not move the respective data.


Faster Carpet
---------

Increases the speed that you move on the flying carpet by 1.5x


Carpet Improvement
-------

When jumping off of a flying carpet, the carpet's vertical movement is no longer halted


Carry Most Things Through Doors
------

Allows you to carry most items and enemies through doors (instead of just keys). Note that this does not include Hawkgates since you would then be able to carry things across levels. Also note the following:
* Bombs and Bob-ombs carried through doors will immediately explode in the next room
* Mushroom Blocks still cannot be carried through doors (for unknown reasons)


Charge Jump Fix
------

Performing a Charge Jump while carrying something and holding B no longer automatically throws what you're carrying. Special thanks to SpiderDave for the original fix! 


Faster Digging
-------

Enables all four characters to dig sand faster by halving the length of the digging animation and applying max fall speed once sand has been cleared. Be sure to use the correct version depending on the base rom you are using


Move During Boss Fanfare
------

After defeating a world boss, the game no longer freezes while the victory music is playing, allowing the player to continue to the next world right away


Mushroom Hints
------

Reveals the locations of Mushrooms on the overworld with a light beam (you still have to enter Subspace to collect them)


Disable Bomb Flashing
------

Removes the flashing effect from Bomb explosions, instead changing the sky to a static orange when a bomb explodes
