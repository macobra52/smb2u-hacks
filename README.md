# smb2u-hacks

This is a collection of various SMB2 (US) modifications created primarily as settings for my randomizer, but can also have uses with various romhacks provided they do not move the respective data locations. All patches here are free to use/modify. I just ask that proper credit is given in your respective distributions.

Special thanks to Xkeeper for their amazing work on the disassembly of SMB2. A lot of the work here would not be possible without it. https://github.com/Xkeeper0/smb2


Usage
-----

The patches here will all be in IPS format. These can be applied to an existing rom through the use of a patching utility, such as Lunar IPS. The patch cannot be removed once appliced so be sure to backup your original rom first.

Steps for Lunar IPS:

* [Download <link>](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/) and run Lunar IPS
* Ensure your target rom has been extracted from zip
* Select 'Apply patch'
* Follow the title screen in popups - select the ips file, then select target rom
* You should see a 'File successfully patched' prompt. At this point you are good to go. Be sure to rename the rom appropriately
